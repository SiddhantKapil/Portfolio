Hi there, thanks for stopping by. I am Siddhant Kapil, a curious Software Developer who likes to explore new technologies and use them to solve challenging real-world use cases. I am highly experienced in designing algorithms and backend development, and fairly experienced in frontend developement. I am also honing my skills in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.

### A Little More About Me

I am a first-year graduate student at UMBC pursuing MS in Computer Science. My estimated graduation date is May 2021. As of now, I am holding a GPA of 4. My primary areas of interest are Algorithms and Machine Learning. At UMBC, I am working as a Research Assistant for Prof. David Chapman on design a novel deep learning algorithm for generating images similar to the input images. 
Before joining UMBC, I used to work as a Senior Associate at Nagarro Software Pvt. Ltd. where I contributed in designing various Software Engineering and Machine Learning projects. My day-to-day at Nagarro was to work closely with ML experts and design data processing pipelines for large-scale Machine Learning models.

1) Deslant Cursive Handwritten Text in Images: 
__Problem:__ One of the challenges in performing OCR on handwritten text is the slanting text. It should be corrected otherwise it may affect the text detection or word cropping in some cases. 
__Solution:__ To solve this I devloped an Image Processing Algorithm completely from scratch. This algorithm first calculate the slantinf factor of the text and then the translate the image using that slanting factor to deslant it.
__Result:__ On my custom dataset this algorithm increased the word slicing accuracy by 9% and overall detection accuracy by 6%.
